The first line contains the following data:
N M C P T

Where:
	N:= number of nodes
	M:= number of markets
	C:= number of customers
	P:= number of products
	T:= time limit

The next N lines contain the following data:
id x y s

Where:
	id:= node id
	x:= x coordinate
	y:= y coordinate
	s:= service time

Consider that:
	* Node 0 is the depot
	* Nodes 1 to M are markets
	* Node M+1 to M+C are customers

The next P lines contain the following data:
p s0

Where:
	p:= product id
	s0:= initial stock of product id

The next PxM matrix is the offer matrix, where each entry (p,m) is the available quantity of product p in the market labeled as m+1.

The next PxM matrix is the price matrix, where each entry (p,m) is the sale price of product p in the market labeled as m+1. If entry (p,m) is equal to zero, the market m+1 does not offer the product p.

The next PxC matrix is the demand matrix, where each entry (p,c) is the quantity of product p that is demanded by customer labeled as c+M+1.

Remarks
*******

* The routing costs (times) are given by the Euclidean distance, rounded to the nearest integer
* The route starts and ends at node 0 (depot)
* If the instance is not capacitated, then for each product, we assume that the offer in the markets that sale it is equal to the sum of the demands.
